data dictionary for abbreviations used in ‘artmusePatient_XXX.txt’ files showing session data. These are the terms found in the header column. 

trial - trial number for proceeding data (1-80)
stimOnsetTime - for trial N, time in seconds (relative to experiment start) the base image of trial N appeared
exptCond - experimental condition; 0 = identical trial, 1 = similar trial
stimNum - number of the folder (1-80) that the base image and comparison image was drawn from
cue - the cue that appeared on the screen before the base image; 1 = ‘ART’, 2 = ‘ROOM’
probe - the probe that appeared on the screen after the comparison image; 1 = ‘ART’, 2 = ‘ROOM’
valid - validity of the trial; 1 = valid trial, 0 = invalid trial
resp - participant response; 1 = yes there was a match, 0 = no there was not a match
corResp - the correct response for that trial; 1 = yes there was a match, 0 = no there was not a match
Acc - whether the participant was accurate on that trial; 1 = accurate, 0 = inaccurate 
RT - reaction time; the amount of time in seconds it took the participant to respond once the probe appeared on the screen

** note ** for the following variables, the abbreviations denote the trial type and whether it is a hit or false alarm rate using the following logic: 

-	‘e_’ or ‘c_’ = experimental (referred to as ‘similar’ in the manuscript) or control trial (referred to as ‘identical’ in the manuscript)
-	‘V’ or ‘IV’ = valid or invalid trial
-	‘Art’ or ‘Room’ = ‘Art’ or ‘Room trial
-	‘H’ or ‘FA’ = hit or false alarm rate 

In addition, these hit and false alarm rates were calculated on a trial by trial basis such that the value in the final row for each column indicates the final hit/false alarm rate for that trial type. ‘NaN’ = not a number.

e_VArtH - experimental valid art trial; hit rate
e_VArtFA - experimental valid art trial; false alarm rate
e_VRoomH - experimental valid room trial; hit rate
e_VRoomFA - experimental valid room trial; false alarm rate

e_IVArtH - experimental invalid art trial; hit rate
e_IVArtFA - experimental invalid art trial; false alarm rate
e_IVRoomH - experimental invalid room trial; hit rate
e_IVRoomFA - experimental invalid room trial; false alarm rate

c_VArtH - control valid art trial; hit rate
c_VArtFA - control valid art trial; false alarm rate
c_VRoomH - control valid room trial; hit rate
c_VRoomFA - control valid room trial; false alarm rate

c_IVArtH - control invalid art trial; hit rate
c_IVArtFA - control invalid art trial; false alarm rate
c_IVRoomH - control invalid room trial; hit rate
c_IVRoomFA - control invalid room trial; false alarm rate
